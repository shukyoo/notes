* [Difference between exit() and sys.exit() in Python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6501121/difference-between-exit-and-sys-exit-in-python)
> If I use exit() in a code and run it in the shell, it shows a message asking whether I want to kill the program or not. It's really disturbing.

## 总结
1. 程序里使用sys.exit()
2. 交互shell使用exit()
